Being a freelancer I developed tracking for various websites, I faced constant challenges such as iframe tracking and sites built with salesforce.
As Web Analytics Developer my tasks were: 
- Custome Web tracking with JS.
- Implementation of web tracking with GTM.
- Reporting with Google Data Studio.
- Process automation.
- Opt-Out & Opt-In Development.
