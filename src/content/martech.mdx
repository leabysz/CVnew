As the Automation Reports Manager in Google Apps Script, I generated eCommerce performance reports and campaign reports using data from Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads, and internal APIs. I simplified the creation and maintenance of weekly and monthly reports, drastically reducing the team's time.

I created reports and templates for data visualization in Looker Studio, establishing presentation and design standards. I developed a connector for Meta's Graph API, facilitating the visualization of ad data in Looker Studio.

I automated expense and campaign performance alerts, as well as daily reports on advertising accounts and clients. I collaborated with the team to identify new optimization opportunities and explore emerging technologies.

My focus on efficiency has freed up time for strategic activities, strengthening our ability to deliver exceptional results to clients. Excited to continue innovating and staying at the forefront of data analysis.

Success Stories

Developed a Google Spreadsheet containing investment per platform, revenue, ROAS per platform, ACOS, percentage of target, and expenditure. This last two are compared with the percentage of days elapsed in the month and trigger alerts if the budget is above or below a tolerable difference. This automation saved countless hours of manual data updating, prevented excessive budget spending, and enabled early optimization in cases where performance metrics were low.

Created an automation that sent a daily email with all Meta and Google Ads advertising accounts that were not functioning. This allowed us to quickly detect when an advertising account had a problem and campaigns were not running.
