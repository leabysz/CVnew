I am proficient in digital data collection, processing, and analysis, with a focus on delivering high-quality, actionable insights. I have designed and executed comprehensive measurement strategies, working closely with product ownership teams to define success metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Exhibiting strong leadership skills, I exercise meticulous control over project outcomes, timelines, and quality, and take full responsibility for meeting these objectives. I have hands-on experience in tag implementation and ongoing maintenance using Google Tag Manager, ensuring accurate data capture.

To guarantee data integrity, I routinely conduct audits and credibility testing, thereby ensuring the reliability of the insights generated. I am also responsible for end-to-end project management, from initial approval through to successful closure, and have experience in team leadership, making operational decisions to ensure timely project completion.

Additionally, I have conducted comprehensive Web Analytics training sessions designed to enhance the skill sets of both existing team members and new hires, thereby contributing to overall team proficiency and effectiveness.
